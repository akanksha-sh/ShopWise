# ShopWise

A holistic shopping experience application developed for ICHACK 2020. It provides a scalable service where small shops can use self checkout easily by allowing customers to scan and pay, view healthier, cleaner, cheaper alternatives as well as suggested recipes for scanned items. 

It uses chain history through a distributed ledger service built on Kaleido to allow users to track food supply chain via block-chain ecosystem with smart contract.

Additionally, it utilises CISCOâ€™s Meraki API to create a synchronised item grabbing verification system storing timestamped snapshots. 


Devloped by a team of 5 developers. Original repo is hosted on Gitlab at: https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/ab5518/ichack20
